NOTE: the actual pdf form which needs to be submitted is
[here](http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/CSPROJECTS/Independent_Study_Contract.pdf).
However, collaboratively editing a pdf is a bit gross, so you should write your
project up in this markdown file and then copy-paste it into the pdf form just
before submission.

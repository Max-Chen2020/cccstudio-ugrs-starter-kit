If you're going to be doing research with the c/c/c studio, we'd love to let the
world know about it :)

Write a paragraph or two about yourself & your project. If you need some
inspiration, have a look at the existing bios on the [c/c/c studio people
page](https://cs.anu.edu.au/code-creativity-culture/people/) (since that's where
yours will go when you've written it up).

Finally, add a photo you'd like to use alongside your bio to this repo (in the
`ccc-website` folder alongside this file).
